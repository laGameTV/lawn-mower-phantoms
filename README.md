This resource pack makes phantoms even more annoying by turning them into loud, buzzing lawn mowers.

Inspired by the legendary "[Lawn Mower Vine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJtZKXqDi64)", this ressource pack adds an extra layer of auditory torment to your Minecraft nights.

# Requirements

[![Requires EMF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1760f36e-c084-4dda-b88d-85facce9f23a)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features)

This ressource pack makes use of Optifine's CMF, so you'll need to use Optifine or an alternative like [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) (Recommended).

Be sure to disable the mycelium particles with mods like [Sodium Extra](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-extra) or similar for optimal use.
